# Google Meet Bot with GPT Integration

This project involves building a bot using Node.js that joins Google Meet meetings, interprets verbal input from participants, and responds verbally using GPT. The goal is to create a system where you can interact with GPT over Google Meet by converting voice input to text, processing it using GPT, converting the text response back to spoken word, and feeding the response back through Google Meet.

If you encounter difficulties with Google Meet, you can choose an alternate video conferencing service of your choice.

## Requirements

To use this bot, you need to fulfill the following requirements:

1. Build a bot using Node.js that can join Google Meet meetings when provided with a meeting link.

2. Implement a speech-to-text feature that can convert voice input from the Google Meet meeting into text.


3. Utilize GPT to process the text obtained from the speech-to-text conversion.

4. Implement a text-to-speech feature that converts the GPT response into speech, which is then passed through Google Meet.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
